designed to recognize timbres and / or characteristics / behavior of the sound.
With a total of 77 features (inputs) it uses centroid, fundamental frequency, generated MIDI notes, 
24 frequency peaks and 25 spectrum bands.

“Activate Gate System” function it has been designed so that when an input signal is detected (with the appropriate threshold) it starts recording and stops it automatically. To stop the system just deactivate the "Activate Gate System" button again. The simple procedure can also be used by simply using the bangs connected to "Start Rec" and "Stop Rec”.
